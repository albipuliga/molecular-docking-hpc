# Molecular Docking Optimization with HPC

This project demonstrates the power of **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** in molecular docking simulations by implementing parallelization techniques. Using [**RDKit**](https://www.rdkit.org/) as the core docking engine, the project provides a comprehensive benchmarking system to analyze performance improvements across different threading configurations.

## Overview

Molecular docking is a computational technique used in drug discovery to predict binding orientations of small molecule drug candidates to their protein targets. These simulations are computationally intensive, particularly when evaluating a large number of conformers or testing many ligand-receptor pairs.

This project leverages parallel processing to significantly reduce computation times, demonstrating the advantages of HPC in optimizing molecular docking workflows. The implementation uses multithreading to distribute the conformer generation and scoring tasks across available CPU cores. By splitting the workload, the project achieves substantial speedups compared to sequential execution, as validated through detailed benchmarking across various system configurations.

**Key improvements include:**

- Utilization of thread pools for efficient task distribution.
- A scalable design capable of handling high-throughput docking studies.
- Benchmarks showing up to **10x** speedup for certain workloads, highlighting the impact of parallelization on computational efficiency.
